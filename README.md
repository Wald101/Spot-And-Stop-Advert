# Spot And Stop

## The Problem

Crime is an ever increasing problem in South Africa. Although crime is reported to the police, a lot of crime still unreported. 
It is also difficult to monitor where crime hotspots are. Police also struggle to monitor crime.

## Solution

Spot-And-Stop is a mobile application which allows people to report crime quickly and easily using a combination of the hardware and software of a mobile device. 
The app also shows crime hotspots based on the crime reported to that area. Lastly the app notifies the police of crime as it happens.
